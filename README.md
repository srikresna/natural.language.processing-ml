# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project
## Overview
Natural language processing (NLP) is a machine learning technology that gives computers the ability to interpret, manipulate, and understand human language. This project is able to identify text and infer what is written in the text. 

## About Dataset
>> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrutyunjaybiswal/iitjee-neet-aims-students-questions-data

The dataset contains Students-questions.csv file in version 1 as of now.
Inside the CSV file, we have two columns:

* eng: The full question or description of the questions
* Subject: Which subject does the question belong to. It has 4 classes, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics.
So, it's basically an NLP problem where we have the question description and we need to find out which subject does this question belongs to.

## Usage
Open jupyter notebook & run `.ipynb` file

## Dependencies
Import following library :
* Kaggle
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* SKLearn
